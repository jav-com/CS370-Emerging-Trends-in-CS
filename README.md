Pirate Intelligent Agent

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

For this assignment I was given some of the code base but tasked with creating a Q-algorithm designed for reinforcement learning which would, in turn, allow the "pirate" to find and use the quickest and most efficient route in finding the treasure.  I found this course to be one of the most practical and educational courses I have taken thusfar in my educational journey.  I truly enjoyed the hands on experience with AI and learning about the future possibilities of it.  

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Put simply, computer scientists develop code and/or entire programs in order to solve real world problems.  I feel that this is important because as our technology develops and evolves at a rapid pace it is important to make it work for us and not against us.  I feel that it becomes our job as computer scientists to bridge the gap between technology and the rest of the world.  

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

For me personally, I begin with identifying the problem(s) at hand, once I have done this I then begin brainstorming on the type of algorithms that can be utilized to solve this problem while maintaining the most direct and efficient programming and also keeping in mind the ethical side of things while I am beginning the development process.  From here I develop the code, test it and execute it to ensure its overall functionality solves the problem(s) I set out to solve.  

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

One of the key and most crucial ethical responsibilites we have as computer scientists is to respect the user's privacy and to ask for permission to collect data.  Another important thing that this course pointed out to me was to be aware of any potential biased programming in our use of artificial inteliigence.  A key takeaway I had from this course came in the form of a question I can ask myself moving forward.  It is "Are there more benefits than issues with what I am developing?"  I feel by asking myself this on every project will ensure that I remain on the right track from both a professional standpoint and an ethical one.
